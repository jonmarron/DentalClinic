Dental Clinic

A dental clinic needs a system to help administer patient records. Each patient has a record with his or her id and name.
In the clinic, each dental staff person also has a record that tracks who works with a patient (dentist, dental hygienist, x-ray technician). Because the system focuses on patient administration records, only minimal information is kept about each dental staff person, such as name and specialisation.
During each visit, more than one dental staff person can be involved in doing a procedure. For example, the x-ray technician, dentist, and dental hygienist can all be involved on a single visit. Historical records are kept for each visit. These information include the type of procedure, a description, the tooth involved, the staff members involved in the procedure.
A patient is marked as a loyal customer if they had more than 3 visits in the last month.
Sometimes dentists like to see a list of the procedures they performed during a week or month, and they can request that report.
For compliance reasons, the manager of the clinic would like to see all patients that a specific staff member interacted with.
